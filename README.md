The purpose was to offer quantities of videos to enable the development of motion correction algorithms
for subsequent data acquisition. The algorithm/program should be able to accurately adjust which pixels
are sampled within each frame to keep a Region-of-Interest within the target area and, thus, produce a
more sensitive and accurate quantification.
